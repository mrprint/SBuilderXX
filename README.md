# SBuilderX

SBuilderX is a tool to design sceneries for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This repository corresponds to present version 3.15 and contains all the files to compile the tool using Visual Studio 2017 (community edition). 

By releasing the source code, I hope that the tool could be improved with the help of flight simmers and programmers. I know that the code is not well organized and that it will be difficult to understand the procedures and the algorithms used in the programme. In fact when I started to write the tool, more than 12 years ago, I never thought in releasing the source code. But, I will do my best to explain any any aspects of the programme if you think  you can improve its performance. Collaboration is most welcome!
