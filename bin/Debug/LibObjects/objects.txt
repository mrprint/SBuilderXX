;     This file should only be used with:

;     SBuilderX 3.04 or later
;     ***********************

; Lines started by ; are comments and are ignored
; Lines enclosed in [] are category designators.
; You can have more objects references in secondary files
; using the include directive in the "objects.txt" file. 
; The secondary files should exist in the SBuilder/Tools/
; folder and they are processed after the processing of
; the primary - "objects.txt" - file. 

; You can enter your objects in any of the following 3 forms:

; 6dc7e21e4f0c4d7395488dac102499a1 0 38 14 1 ag_barn
; 6dc7e21e4f0c4d7395488dac102499a1 1 38 14 1 ag_barn
; {6dc7e21e-4d73-4f0c-ac8d-4895a1992410} 2 38 15 1 ag_barn

; In the 1st case the object is placed using FS8 techniques
; and you can control some extra visibility parameters. In the
; 2nd case it will be placed via SCASM exactly in the same way
; as BGLComp from the FS2004 SDK. In the 3rd case the object
; be placed with FSX' BGLComp.

;     SBuilderX 3.13 or later

; 2 - All object definitions should be moved to secondary files
; 3 - Thumbnails need to be JPEG type. All that is needed is to place
